Recaps Switcher
------------------------------------

This simple program allows you to switch between languages using only one reconfigurable Key - like the CapsLock one that is set by default.

Just press The Key and the language will change. You can use Alt-Key if you'd like to bypass the switcher and execute originally assigned Key action.

If you accidentally typed some text in the wrong layout, Ctrl-Key should fix it.

If you have more than two languages installed, you can configure ones you want to cycle through using context menu of the application's icon.

Additional indication about currently active layout may be reconfigurable country flag in the application icon and ScrollLock keyboard LED.

Yet another key may be assigned to execute optional "Eject CD" action.

Enjoy!
